	1. The 20-24 age bracket is a major group to target for marketing purposes.As shown from the above dataframes, specifically the age_purchasing_analysis_df, this group had the most purchases and greatest total purchase value. A following analysis can be performed to assess the genres of games that should be particularly advertised/are successful based on this age bracket.

	2. Males, as indicated from the gender_purchasing_analysis_df, have made the most purchases in comparison to females and other/non-disclosed individuals. However females and other/non-disclosed individuals had the higher average in purchase price and average total purchase value per person than males. This could be on account of the lack of games targeted towards these specific groups. From this, what can be considered is an evaluation of age group and gender demographics to assess what specific groups are spending the most, and whether to consider a shift in focus in advertisement and/or genres.

	3. "Final Critic" was both the most profitable and popular game which is seen in the most_popular_df and most_profitable_df. Despite, its high price in comparison to other popular games, its audience seemed to not be disuaded from purchasing it, hence it may be advisable to analysis its data specifically for trends in regard to why it was so successful. (For example, was it the marketing approach, the genre, the story, the length of gameplay, etc.)
